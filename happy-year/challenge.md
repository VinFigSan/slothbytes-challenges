# Next Happy Year
Sloth needs your help to find out the next happy year.
A Happy Year is the year with only distinct digits (no duplicates).
Create a function that takes an integer year and returns the next happy year.

## Examples
> happyYear(2017)
> output = 2018
> **2018 is the next happy year with all numbers being different.**
> happyYear(1990)
> output = 2013
> **2013 is the next happy year with all numbers being different.**
> happyYear(2021)
> output = 2031
> **2031 is the next happy year with all numbers being different.**
